                    <p>This is definitely a fan favourite. In loving memory of Mr. Jecton and c++. C++ is dearly missed. Anyone who went through OOP knows the struggle and fight for our lives in sem 2. Hope we all meet on the 50%+ side.üôèüèæ</p>

                    <p>This has happened to all of us at one point. Late online submission. You found yourself sweating the last bits of your assignment to beat the infamous <strong>11:59</strong>. Plus, I know it says <strong>11:99</strong> on the meme, but as declared before, we ain't memers here. We have better things to do with our lives.</p>
